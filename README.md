# Content Aware Image Resizing Program




## Overview:
This program implements a Content Aware Image Resizing algorithm using dynamic programming techniques. The algorithm intelligently resizes images while preserving important visual content, minimizing distortion typically associated with traditional resizing methods.


## Key Features:

 - Seam Removal: Iteratively identifies and removes seams with the lowest energy from the image.
 - Dynamic Programming: Efficiently calculates the minimum energy seam path for resizing.
 - Vertical Index Map: Maintains a map to visualize the impact of seam removal on the image.
 

## Implementation Details:

- Language: C#
- Dependencies: .NET Framework 4.0
